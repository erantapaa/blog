### Definition

An algorithm to find prime numbers up to a number $$n$$

### Algorithm description

Using a boolean vector of size $$n$$ iteratively mark all the multiples of nonvisited positions as not primes

### Implementation

Time complexity: $$O(tn)$$, $$t$$ is the number of primes between $$1$$ and $$t$$

```cpp
{% include code/math/sieve.cpp %}
```
